# agent_hyperion

A coding agent that reads code like a human does, walks folder trees, analyzes imports, parses ASTs and reasons about where to go next. Context heavy, code aware and developer minded.

## Setup

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the agent via the CLI:

```bash
python -m hyperion.cli --name Hyperion
```

## Testing

Execute the test suite with `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```
